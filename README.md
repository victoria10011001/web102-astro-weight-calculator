The Astro Weight Calculator was developed to show how much you would weigh on a different planet. In the "Calculate Weight" section, you can put in a certain weight in pounds and then choose the planet you would like to calculate your weight on. When you submit your weight, the site will tell you how much you would weigh if you were on that other planet. The weight multiplier is prepopulated with the default planets in the drop down.

If you would like to add your own planet with a unique weight multiplier, you can do that in the "Imput Custom Planet" section. This adds your custom planet as an item in the drop down menu in the "Calculate Weight" section.

Enjoy!
